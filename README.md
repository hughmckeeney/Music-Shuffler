# Music-Shuffler

This was is an individual software engineering project in C. The aim of the project was to create a program to take in a max of 4 artists with a max of 3 songs each.
The program then sorts and prints the list of songs in alphabetical order, grouped by the artist.
Then a random "shuffled" playlist of the songs given is created ensuring that the same song can only appear again after at least 5 other songs had been listed, and the same song cannot appear in the list more than twice.
